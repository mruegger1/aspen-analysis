## Running the Analysis Pipeline
This guide explains how to execute the real estate data analysis pipeline.

### Steps to Run the Analysis
Run the following scripts in order:

```bash
# Premium location analysis
python3 premium-locations/premium_address_analysis.py

# Time adjustment analysis
python3 time-adjustments/time_adjusted_analysis.py

# STR impact analysis
python3 str-analysis/str_gondola_analysis.py

## Output Files
Each script generates CSV outputs that serve as inputs for subsequent steps:

| File Name                         | Description                          |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|

| `cleaned_real_estate_dataset.csv` | Dataset after cleaning               |
| `real_estate_with_condition.csv`  | Dataset with property condition data |
